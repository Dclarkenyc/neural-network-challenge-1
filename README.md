# neural-network-challenge-1
##
### Description:
The assignment was to predict student loan repayment fullfillment using a 
neural network model.  First the data was cleaned then a TensorFlowâ€™s Keras 
model was compiled and evaulted and loan repayment predictions were made and 
discussed.

### Usage:
Run the file student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb

### Resources:
The completed assignment is in the neural-network-challenge-1 folder - the file is student_loans_with_deep_learning. The dataset came from 
[*student_loans_csv*](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m18/lms/datasets/student-loans.csv) 
an external source. The model was saved in the Source_Code folder - model_model.keras

### Known Issues:
I had some trouble getting the printouts to look like the original responses 
- could be because I am not using Colab as we were told we did not have to use it.
I also had trouble printing out just a sample of the predictions - all of it
printed out.  Finally I ended up reimporting tensorflow before fitting keras.  
I was getting errors running so reimported tensorflow and others.

### Acknowledgements:
The Xpert Asst helped me to get the keras model input correctly.
