# neural-network-challenge-1
##
### Description:
The assignment was to predict student loan repayment fullfillment using a 
neural network model.  First the data was cleaned then a TensorFlow’s Keras 
model was compiled and evaulted and loan repayment predictions were made and 
discussed.

### Usage:
Run the file student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb

### Resources:
The completed assignment is in the neural-network-challenge-1 folder - the file is student_loans_with_deep_learning. The dataset came from 
[*student_loans_csv*](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m18/lms/datasets/student-loans.csv) 
an external source. The model was saved in the Source_Code folder - model_model.keras

### Known Issues:
I had some trouble getting the printouts to look like the original responses - could be because I am not using Colab as we were told we do not have to use it.  I did use it for the final assignment since it did not run on python.

### Acknowledgements:
The Xpert Asst helped me to get the keras model input correctly - I kept getting shape-related errors.
